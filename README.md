All melee weapons can be dual and varsatile wielded. Properly hip sheathed one handed weapons, with matching animations. Weapon based skill casts can be repeated from the off-hand.
Compatible with any mod, and their added spells.

When dual wielding any spells or attacks cast with the main hand weapon generate a free off hand attack which mirrors the attack you used, it costs no resources to use, and allows you to choose another target with the same spell but in your off hand.

With this mod:

    Dual wield any melee weapon, including two-handed.
    Sheathe any one handed weapon, hand crossbows included, on your hips, all weapons with proper matching animations
    All melee weapons, and hand crossbows, are now Versatile
    Repeat mainhand attacks or spells in your offhand for free
    Add your ability score to offhand attacks always


After using the free off hand attack your AC is reduced by 3 until your next turn.
When dual wielding, the dual wielded weapons have their chance to hit reduced by 3.
Two weapon fighting was changed to now mitigate these penalties when dual wielding.

Optional MCM integration to change these values
