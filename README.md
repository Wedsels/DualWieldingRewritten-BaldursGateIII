A rework of dual wielding, allowing for more freedom and control, and a wider variety of skills to be affected by dual wielding.
Compatible with any mod, and their added spells.

When dual wielding any spells or attacks cast with the main hand weapon generate a free off hand attack which mirrors the attack you used, it costs no resources to use, and allows you to choose another target with the same spell but in your off hand.

After using the free off hand attack your AC is reduced by 3 until your next turn.

When dual wielding, the dual wielded weapons have their chance to hit reduced by 3.

Ability score is always added to off hand attacks.

Two weapon fighting was changed to now mitigate the losses incurred when dual wielding.

Requires Script Extender.
Load order does not matter, place anywhere.
Can be installed and uninstalled freely.
